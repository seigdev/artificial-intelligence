    "Tokenization is the process of breaking up a string into tokens. Commonly, these tokens are words, numbers, and/or punctuation. The `tensorflow_text` package provides a number of tokenizers available for preprocessing text required by your text-based models. By performing the tokenization in the TensorFlow graph, you will not need to worry about differences between the training and inference workflows and managing preprocessing scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide discusses the many tokenization options provided by TensorFlow Text, when you might want to use one option over another, and how these tokenizers are called from within your model."
